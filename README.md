# Restaurant Cubaneros 
![mockup](readme_img/amiresponsive.png)

My project is a restaurant website which represents a traditional rustic cuban cuisine. The websites main features, as 'about', 'menu', contacts' displays the 'read' part of CRUD to the user and gives the important information about the websites goal to the user, while the admin can change and update the same information from the backend. The crucial part of the project is the 'book here!'(or the booking form) and 'my bookings' which gives the user/admin the possibility for 'create', 'update' and 'delete' in CRUD, so that a reservation/booking can be created, edited or removed. As admin these bookings can be approved or rejected and the status of this action reflects in the frontend presentation, which gives the user the possibility to follow up the status themselves.
