# Restaurant Cubaneros 
![mockup](readme_img/amiresponsive.png)

My project is a restaurant website which represents a traditional rustic cuban cuisine. The websites main features, as 'about', 'menu', contacts' displays the 'read' part of CRUD to the user and gives the important information about the websites goal to the user, while the admin can change and update the same information from the backend. The crucial part of the project is the 'book here!'(or the booking form) and 'my bookings' which gives the user/admin the possibility for 'create', 'update' and 'delete' in CRUD, so that a reservation/booking can be created, edited or removed. As admin these bookings can be approved or rejected and the status of this action reflects in the frontend presentation, which gives the user the possibility to follow up the status themselves.

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku]().

## User Experience (UX)

Users visiting the restaurants website are looking for a new place to explore. We are offering a real rustic traditional experiance to excape the luxuary fancy vibe but still a place to fine dine. 

The front page provides the user with all the necessary content so they could decide if that is the place they want to explore. If not authenticated they can access almost all the content of the page until it gets to the reservation part of it, for which authentication is required.

Everyone can enjoy their visit to our website because we have adjusted it and designed for all different screen sizes.
